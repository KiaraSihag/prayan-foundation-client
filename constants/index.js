We also offered thoughtful gifts of bananas, buttermilk, and biscuits, which brought happiness to the residents. Drive in the month of June We organized a donation drive at Human Peace Foundation, Nirman Vihar, providing essential items like biscuits, hand towels, and sandos to support the well-being of the residents. The smiles on their faces while receiving the gifts were priceless! Through these drives, Sampriyata's continues to spread happiness and care among the elderly, fostering a sense of togetherness and love in every interaction.
