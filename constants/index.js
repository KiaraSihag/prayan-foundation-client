        content: " After conducting our first drive in the month of May, we headed enthusiastically towards our second drive on June 28 . First of all, we identified the areas with maximum population of stray dogs and cats in the GTB Nagar region.In the hot and humid weather of Delhi, we set up 8 water bowls in different areas to provide clean drinking water for animals. We also supplied them with 4 liters of milk, chapatis, and dog food to meet their nutritional needs. Our efforts included engaging with the local community, promoting animal welfare and rights. The residents greatly supported our work and embraced our guidelines on proper animal care. Overall, the endeavor concluded successfully, achieving our mission to a great extent.As we strolled along the streets of GTB Nagar, we received heartfelt appreciation from the locals for our compassion towards animals in the scorching heat. They also shared valuable suggestions on strategic placements of water and food bowls to reach and help as many dogs as possible. Their encouragement motivated us to work even harder for the welfare of animals. With this being our second drive, the volunteers were much more optimistic and actively participated, bringing chapatis and beautifully designed posters to raise awareness among people. Above all, the strong team spirit and collective effort to make a positive change in humanity filled each of us with a great sense of positivity.",

It proved to be an incredible and interactive experience for us.According to students' feedback, there is a pressing need to increase awareness about women empowerment. They emphasized the prevalence of women being exploited in offices, workplaces, and homes, and stressed the importance of reducing such incidents and treating women equally to men. Students also highlighted the significance of family support for women to confidently address exploitation and voice their concerns. They urged against the misuse of women's rights.Overall, the drive provided valuable insights into college students' awareness regarding women empowerment.",
